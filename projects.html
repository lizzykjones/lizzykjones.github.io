    <h3>Why Higher Order Mean Motion Resonances are Weak: A Physical and Geometric Model (Harvey Mudd College)</h3>
    <p>Mean motion resonances (MMRs) play a pivotal role in planetary dynamics, serving as both a source of stability and chaos. MMR strengths scale at small eccentricities as <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">e<sup>k</sup></span>, where <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">k</span> is the order of the resonance, a crucial result which helps characterize unstable regions where MMRs overlap. The traditional derivation for this result using a perturbation series expansion approach provides little physical intuition. In this research project we present a simple physical explanation for this scaling result. In the limit that planets are closely spaced, interplanetary interactions are negligible except at close encounters when one planet overtakes the other and imparts a gravitational “kick” to the planet's mean motion. By considering previously known Fourier expansions for these kicks, we show that the <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">k</span>-fold symmetry in conjunction locations leads to a cancellation of terms up to order <span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', serif;">e<sup>k-1</sup></span>.</p>

    <h3>Benchamarking Supernova Pointing using Machine Learning (CERN)</h3>
    <p>Core-collapse supernovae are some of the most energetic events in the universe, but many aspects of the explosion mechanism and the associated neutrino emission remain poorly understood. Most of a supernova’s energy is carried away by neutrinos, making their detection essential for probing the physics at the heart of the collapse and for constraining neutrino properties themselves. The next-generation Hyper-Kamiokande (HK) experiment in Japan will be the world’s largest water Cherenkov detector and is expected to collect orders of magnitude more neutrinos than the current Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector during the next nearby core collapse supernova. In anticipation of this event, we simulate supernova events in HK and apply machine-learning algorithms to reconstruct the supernova direction and differentiate between different theoretical emission models. In this research project, we compare three architectures—convolutional neural networks (CNNs), graph neural networks (GNNs), and sparse CNNs—and evaluate their ability to infer the supernova direction from simulated photomultiplier tube hit patterns. Our results show that the sparse CNN significantly outperforms the other architectures: for a supernova at 8 kpc, it reconstructs the direction to within 2.4° on average assuming no contamination from inverse beta decay events.</p>

    <h3>An Inference Based Study of Neutrino Oscillation (American Museum of Natural History)</h3>
    <p>The solar property of electron number density has important implications for understanding solar and stellar physics, yet its precise distribution within the Sun is unknown. While current models are derived from measurements at the solar surface, it would be a novel approach to use Earth-based measurements to predict electron distribution in the Sun. Electron number density dictates the flavor evolution of neutrinos as they stream radially outward from the Sun, and thus determines their flavor when they reach detectors on Earth. In this study, we explored an inference-based approach that uses neutrino flavor measurements from Earth-bound detectors to extrapolate the Sun’s electron density function. We studied logistic and exponential forms of electron number density and ultimately sought the sparsest amount of data required to place useful constraints on the model.</p>
